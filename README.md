Goal- To create a smart search tool that allows users to find relevant free courses on 
Analytics Vidhya’s platform.
 • Here's how I approached the assignment:
 • Data Collection: I began by scraping the free courses' titles and relevant metadata such as course links and 
images from Analytics Vidhya’s platform. using beautifulsoup
 • Model Selection: Initially, I experimented with the Groq API for generating embeddings and conducting 
searches. However, I found that the results were not as appropriate, prompting me to switch to a more refined 
solution using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers).
 • I used the pre-trained BERT model (bert-base-uncased) to generate embeddings for both the user query and the 
course titles.
 • Relevance: To match user queries with the most relevant courses, I computed cosine similarity between the 
user’s query embedding and the course title embeddings. This similarity score helped rank the courses based on 
relevance.
 • Real-Time Autocomplete Feature: I implemented a real-time autocomplete feature that suggests the top 3 course 
titles based on the user's input. It uses string matching to enhance the user experience.
 • Gradio Interface: I designed and deployed the user interface using Gradio and implemented a clean, user
friendly layout for presenting the course search results. The interface dynamically displays relevant course 
details, such as the title, image, link, and a relevance score.
 • Deployment on Huggingface Spaces: I deployed the search tool on Huggingface Spaces, making it publicly 
accessible for review. The interface was customized using CSS for better visual appeal and responsiveness.
